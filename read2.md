- now if you want to make it italic add one star befor and after the world like the following : *Banana*
- add a link by typing the website name between two squared bracets[] followed by the website link between normal bracets() to get this [google](https://www.google.com/)

- add an unordered list by adding - sign or * at the first of the line.
- add an ordered list by adding 1 and the . sign at the first of the line.

- add a blockqoute by palcing > sign at the first of each line to get this

> we all like bananas
- write in line code by adding backtick  before and after our code to get this `<html>`
- Syntax highlighting to get the following by adding 3 backticks before and after or by adding four spaces at the begining
```javascript
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if(arg) {
    $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
  }
}
```

    function fancyAlert(arg) {
      if(arg) {
        $.facebox({div:'#foo'})
      }
    }

-create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |

- write any link like this (like http://www.github.com/) it will convert it into a clickable link.
- add emojis by placing : before and after the emoji description like this :smile:
