# markup Tags

#### they are a bunch of tags which makes elements that contain the content of the page.

#### they give the browser rthe ability to correct structure of the webpage upon loading. 


## heading tags 
1. `<h1>`
2. `<h2>`
3. `<h3>`
4. `<h4>`
5. `<h5>`
6. `<h6>` 
#### they determine the importance of the content inside of them starting from the most important in `<h1>` to the least impoortant in `<h6`.
#### since `<h1>` is the most important content in the webpage its the first thing that search engine would look for in the entire webpage to determine the relevance of the webpage content with what the user is searching for .

- here is an example on how to write a heading 
> ```<h1> the content of the heading </h1>```

## 3 ways we can use CSS 
1. inline 
> to change the style of an element all you have to do is right a styke attribut inside the opening tag so if we want to change the background for a paragraph we right the following `<p style="background-color:red;"> content </p>` and the output p will have a red background .
2. internal 
> if we want to change the styyle for a single html page we use the internal CSS by adding `<style></style>` in the heading of the page 
> here is an example for changing the text color of the links in a single page ```a{color :red;} ```
3. external
> now when it comes to the real world the most effective way of using css is via an external css file and here is how to use it 
* create a file with `.css` extention 
* type the following in the head of your html webpage `<link href="" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">`
* go to your css file and add the desirable attributes in the following syntax `body {color:red;}`
