# object 
>Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model 
of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, 
variables and functions take on new names.

#### so an object contains : 
1. variables (properties)
> the define specific attributes about the object  
2. functions (methods)
> the define a specific seual of processes that will return an output that will serve the object as a whole .

## the basic wa to define an object (object sntax):


```
object-name = {
    var1 : value; "this is a properity",
    var2 : value;  "this is a properity",
    var3 : ['one','two'];  "this is a properity (array)",

    function-name : function(){
        return this.var1-this.var2;   "this is a method"
    }

}
```
### lets crreate a supermarket object

``` 
var supermarket ={
    owner-name : 'ahmad',
    chips-bought:50,
    chips-sold:20,

    stock: function(){
        return this.bought -this.sold;
    }
};
```
* we seperate the properities and methods with **,** and nothing at the end (and we call rach one of them a **key**)
* "this" means we are using the keys of this object 

## how to access the object and its keys ?
1. we type ``` object-name.key-name```
to access the chips-bought key and put it ain a var we do the following :
>> ``` var b-chips= supermarket.chips-bought;```
2. another way to access the peoperties onl not the methods :
>> `` var b-chips= supermarket['bought-chips];``

## we can make as man yobject litterals as we wish 
>> we will make another supermarket wiith the same code but with a different owner called omar
>>> ```var supermarket ={
    owner-name : 'omar',
    chips-bought:5050,
    chips-sold:2001,

    stock: function(){
        return this.bought -this.sold;
    }
};```


## another way to crreate an object is by ddefining the object without any key (without attributes and methods) **blank object** and add them later like following :
>1. reate object 
> ``` var supermarket = new Object(); ```
>2. add keys (properties):
> supermarket.name='ali';
>3. add keys (methods)
>``` supermarket.stock= function()  {return this.bought-this.sold; };```



## delete a key from object 
> ``` delete supermarket.sold;

# DOM (document object model )
#### one of the hardest things to do in programming is t find the real and actual problem domain so what is it 
> its the definition of the problem in the real world its the starting point before you can do any programming you cant just start without having the previous knowledge of the problem you are goiing to solve by proramming .

> so before ou start an programming you should do the following:
>* get a whole look at the problem from different perspectives
>* try to find a solution for it 
>* create a generalized plan to how you could apply the solution in the real world 
>* start planing to apply the solution into a form of website or program by creating a DOM (Document Object Model) tree like the following :
