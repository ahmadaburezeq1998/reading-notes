# HTML & JS

### Hypertext Markup Language, its a standard system for tagging the text files in order to get the aquaired effects on your text and images thal will appear on your webpage on the  internet.





## But what is the internet ?
#### it's tens of thousands of interconnected networks
## What is JS?
#### javaScript is widely used programming languae that we could use with our HTML websites in order to give the end-user the ability to interact with our webpage.

## Now lets see what are the main content of HTML :
1. Tags 
> which are the main component that defines what to do with the text that is going to be in between the two tags that make an element together <p> and this is a paragraph tag as an example.
>
`<p>`
2. Elements 
> which consists of two similar tags that defines the border for the content written inside of these tags and anything inside this element will have the same attributes 
>     
`<tagname> content</tagname>`
3. attributes
> modifies the default functionality of an html element.
> 
`<element attribute_name="value">content</element>  `

## the main tags in HTML 

1. ` <!DOCTYPE>`: It defines the document type or it instruct the browser about the version of HTML.
2. `<html> `:This tag informs the browser that it is an HTML document. Text between html tag describes the web document. It is a container for all other elements of HTML except <!DOCTYPE>
3. `<head>`: It should be the first element inside the <html> element, which contains the metadata(information about the document). It must be closed before the body tag opens.
4. ` <title>`: As its name suggested, it is used to add title of that HTML page which appears at the top of the browser window. It must be placed inside the head tag and should close immediately. (Optional)
5. `<body>` : Text between body tag describes the body content of the page that is visible to the end user. This tag contains the main content of the HTML document.
6. `<h1>` : Text between <h1> tag describes the first level heading of the webpage.
7. `<p>` : Text between <p> tag describes the paragraph of the webpage.
