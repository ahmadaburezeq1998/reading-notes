# Lists in HTML

### Lists is a set of items that we want to show together in a group there is different types of lists since sometimes we want to show a list of items while each item has a number (ordered lists) but sometimes we dont care about numbering the items and we just want them to bee grouped together (unordered lists)
***

## types of lists in HTML 
> **Orderred** lists 

> **Unordered** lists 

> **definition** lists 

## **Ordered** lists 
### more than one items written on top of each other each with a number to show the item position in the llist.

## we have threre colors ***red yellow and blue*** we want to show them in a list while each color has a number in the begining to show us its position we will follow the following example ==>
    <OL>
        <li>Red</li>
        <li>Yellow</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
    </OL>
## And thats going to give us the following output ==>

## **UN Ordered** lists 
### we use them when we want to add a number of items together but with a bullet (dot) at the begininhg of each item rather than numbers since the order for these items doesnt matter 

## we have threre colors ***red yellow and blue*** we want to show them in a list while each color has a **Dot** in the begining Since the position doesnt matter in this type of lists we will follow the following example ==>
        <UL>
        <li>Red</li>
        <li>Yellow</li>
        <li>Blue</li>
        </UL>
## And thats going to give us the following output ==>

## **Definition lists** 
### its a list f item each item has its own definition or its own description ofourse sometime an item inside the list will have more than one def. (description) so we can add ttwo descriptions to the same item list as follow 

### in definition list we use the `<dl></dl>` element to define a definition list ,`<dt></dt>` element to define each term inside the definition list and `<dd></dd>` for each definition for the term above it lets follow the example bellow to understand it more ==>

```html
    <dl>
        <dt>red</dt>
              <dd>the color of a strawberry</dd>

        <dt>yellow</dt>
            <dd>the color of the sun</dd>
            <dd>the color of lemons </dd>
            
        <dt>blue</dt>
            <dd>the color of the sky</dd>
            <dd>the color of sea </dd>
    </dl>
```

## And thats going to give us the following output ==>
