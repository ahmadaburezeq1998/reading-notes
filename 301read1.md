# what is a componet?

## its a set of functions and methods that can be reused anyytime we want anyywhere and however we want 



# What characteristics does it have ?

| list of characteristics |Describtion                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|reusablity               |mostly we can use them in differnent siuations and applications|
|Replaceable              |we can replace them with other components if the others can do the same functionality of the first one|
|Not context specific     |they are designed to do a specific processing on the data and obviousl its not going to be the same data all the time|
|Extensible               |a component can inherit other components and then add other functionalit to it to make it do something different
|Encapsulated             |a component would hide its algorithim from others so theyy ycould use it without knowing how it works in depth|
|Independent              |they are built so the would require minimum to non dependabilty on other components|







# What are the advantages of using component based architecture?

| list of characteristics |Describtion                              |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
|Reduced cost             |we can use components from different sources whil will redduce the cost of development |
|Ease of development      |whenever a new update is released of these copmponents we can add it and replace the old one withoutrr affecting the other ccomponents|
|Reliability              |since each component is inddependent whenever an error shows up its always easy to fix since we know were to look|
|Reusable                 | we can reuse them whenever we want and on many different projects which will decrease the time and cost required to develop the project




# wwhat is props ?


##  it means properities and it's used to move the content from one component to another

## things to know about props are 
- it moves in a one direction flow parent to child
- its a read only 

# how do we use the props in react?

  ## we pass the props to components as the arguments in a function 
   - define the attributes:
     <childcomponent text ={" im 1st child"}

      const Childcomponent= (props)  =>{
          return <p>im 1st child</p>
      };

      - render props data
